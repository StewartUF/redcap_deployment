# Export Large Projects *Created by Andy Martin*
#### Stewart Wehmeyer, UF CTS-IT

## Description

This plugin attempts to address the problems associate with exporting large project. The plugin essentially breaks the download into smaller portions and then ammends them after downloading. This should help prevent crashes or hangs upon downloading.

## Requirements

This plugin requires a working instance of REDCap and needs to be placed in the appropriate plugins directory. It is currently configured for UF redcap_deployment use and will fetch the code stored on a private repo.
